# KSP RealFuels ISRU Capability

## What is this patch file?
I really enjoy playing with the [RealFuels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58236-18-real-fuels/) mod, but it does not work well with the stock `Ore` resource in the game. This is a ModuleManager patch file that allows ISRUs to make Aerozine50, NTO, Kerosene, LqdOxygen, Ethanol75, and HTP from the base game's `Ore` resource to be more compatible with the [RealFuels](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58236-18-real-fuels/) KSP Mod.

## Installation
1. Copy to anywhere in your `GameData` folder.
2. Launch KSP!

## Compatibility
Supports the Stock ISRUs (standard and mini variants) as well as the ISRU included in the [FelineUtilityRover](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155344-112x-feline-utility-rovers-v134-28-april-2022/) mod for use with the Lynx rover platform. Let me know if you know of any other mods that include new ISRU parts, and I will do my best to include them too!
Currently only works with the stock game's `Ore` resource as input, but [Community Resource Pack](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/83007-1x-community-resource-pack/) support for other raw resources is planned/possible. I just do not have the knowledge/time to implement this myself from scratch. Accepting PRs for this change!
